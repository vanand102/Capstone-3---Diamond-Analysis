# Capstone-3---Diamond-Analysis

===============================

The purchase of diamonds is culturally significant in today’s society. They are most purchased as an engagement ring or a gift for a loved one for special occasions. Diamond price is reflective of size, quality and therefore rarity. The higher cut, color, clarity and carat weight, the rarer the stones and therefore the greater the value of diamonds. As determining the appropriate price for a diamond can be complex and depend on many factors, having a tool to help price diamonds can be beneficial for many individuals.
